As we reviewed the usage, we can see that most of the charges are for Virtual machine usage. As you can see in the snip, you have been charged for the above service and you have been charged as per the pricing.

For the current month usage, the invoice is not yet generated.

I can see that you have cancelled the services on 1/3/24. However, the services were running till the date, and you got charges.

Please note all credit/refund request are subjected for review and approval from our Senior Management Team. 

Microsoft does not scan or monitor customers Azure deployments, virtual machines (VMs), networks, or data transfers for security and privacy. The customer is responsible for monitoring Azure usage.

Please note that we cannot adjust the entire charges which got generated. However, we will check with our technical advisor regarding the possibilities for adjusting charges for Dv3/DSv3 Series Windows. Please note we cannot promise any credits for this scenario now.

Kindly let us know how you would like to proceed further.

Best Regards,

Angitha PP
